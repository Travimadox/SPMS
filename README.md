# Switched-Mode Power Supply (SPMS)

**Switched-Mode Power Supply**. It is an electronic power supply that uses a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently from a DC or AC source to DC loads while converting voltage and current characteristics. It is substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply as the transformer is much smaller.

## Features
- **Effeciency**
  
    SMPSs are high efficiency compared to linear power supplies. They use switching components (such       as              transistors or MOSFETs) to regulate the output voltage, minimizing energy loss and heat generation.
  
- **Compact Size**

    SMPS is much smaller and lighter than traditional linear power supplies as it operate at higher                        frequencies and require smaller transformers and filtering components.
  
## Usage
SMPS are used to supply power to a variety of devices, including: 
- consumer electronics such as smartphones, laptops, tablets etc.
- convertion of AC power generated in solar inverters into usable DC      power for electronics in renewable energy systems.
- It can also be employed in networking equipments to provide power and maintain stable network connectivity.
  
## Customization
The SPMS is designed to provide the user the ability to switch to the desired output voltages within the range 5V-9V at maximum current of 1A. It also provide the user with data regarding its effeciency.

## Cost
Our SMPS is produced/manufactured at lower costs without compromising the quality nor its lifespan, making it more affordable compared to traditional linear power supplies.
